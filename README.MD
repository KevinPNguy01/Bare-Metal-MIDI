# Bare Metal MIDI Player on Tiva C Series Microcontroller
![Project Image](images/bare_metal_midi.jpg)

## Overview
This project implements a bare metal MIDI player on a Tiva C Series microcontroller without using any external libraries or an RTOS.

The player reads preloaded MIDI data from the microcontroller's flash memory, parses the MIDI events, and generates sound through a PWM-based audio output connected to a small speaker.

Song metadata such as title, artist, duration, and current playback time are displayed on an attached LCD.

## Features
- Supports playback of songs from standard MIDI files
- Up to 9 different songs preloaded in flash memory
- Up to 8 simultaneous notes (polyphony)
- 4 selectable waveforms: Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Square
- Scrolling text display of current song title and artist name on a connected LCD
- Real-time display of song duration and current playback time
